THINGS TO FIX/FINISH/IMPROVE
----------------------------------

- When the DGuitar Main Window is minimized, minimize the LOG window TOO

- When the DGUITAR_LOG close buttons is pressed perform one of these :
    1. the close operation of the main window (thas asks for saving as necesary)
	2. close the LOG WINDOW, set the menu option and save the contents to LOG file
	
- save the list of recently opened files (on a TXT file, not on the PROPERTIES file)

- Store the Preferred midi device on the DGuitar.properties file

- Palm Mute notes that have a 28.0% occurence (higher than SLIDES 18.0% see EFFECTS.txt)
	- Understand how they are displayed and complexity of implementing it

- a SAVE option when the file been open from HTTP (or other internet protocol)
	save the byte sequence, no need to change CODECS for now

- ALLOW THE USER TO SET THE VOLUME FOR THE MIDI DEVICE

- Allow user to manage favorites (a list of different path for files, ie bookmarks)

- Detect the date of the DGuitar.jar and display that as the BuildDate
	- Display the data of the common.jar file

- Replace the SWINGWORKER for a GNU/GPL Implementation to have ALL software under ONE lincense

- Under MAC OS...when DGuitar is Run from Eclipse..this error appear on the Eclipse Console
	2006-01-18 02:36:38.526 java[964] CFLog (0): CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed 1103 (0x44f), port = 0xe303, name = 'java.ServiceProvider'
	See /usr/include/servers/bootstrap_defs.h for the error codes.
	2006-01-18 02:36:38.527 java[964] CFLog (99): CFMessagePortCreateLocal(): failed to name Mach port (java.ServiceProvider)

    TO:
	c:\myfiles\...\example.gp4

    see Util.compactAndReadableURL()

- Inform TRANSLATORS about strings that need to be Internationalized (LANGUAGES.TXT)

/ Let the user select which midi device he would like to use (Midi Preferences)
	/ enable the button for "Set midi device"
		/ test it under JRE 1.5 (JRE 1.5 is still not available for MacOs !!)
		- test it under JRE 1.4 (does not provide a method for this ?)
	X test what happens when all devices do NOT have receivers
		this means that all devices are for capturing but not for playing
	
- Fix the the -1 values when displaying fret
	"i get some -1 values in the tab where i guess there arepauses or stopped notes"
	"I'm fairly certain that the -1 denotes a string that should be muted.
	
/ Allow user to select between at least two type of included skins (compact, default)
	X create a menu to "Select skin..."
	X store/load the selected skin with the properties file
	X capture and process the menu events 
	/ refresh the skin without relaunching program (if posible)
		- test this..when more windows are open
		- while playing some songs
	
/ JFileChooser should NOT allow the rename of Files/Folders
	/ create and improved version of the JFileChooser (at least 3 complaints)
	check out "DGFileChooser" and "DGFileChooserUI.java"
		- The NEW FOLDER button still appears (usefull when saving..but not when opening)
		- When the view is changed to DETAILS the renaming is still posible !!
		- files can not be sorted using columns

/ Unify the playButton and playPanel of all windows on a playToolbar
	- when two or more songs are playing at the same time the playPanel is updating the plays staus of BOTH !!
		- should the playPanel be refreshed ?
	- When STOP button is pressend and internal frame is ICONIFIED..is not stoping
	- When any music cursor is moved (by clicking), the playPanel should display its location
		- this includes the name of the last clicked TRACK
	X show the information of the current selected frame?
	X SongInternalFrame
	X MidiInternalFrame
	X the playToolbar should display the name of the song is linked to
	X When all windows are closed..reset labels of playToolBar to "empty" and hide them
	- when song is MIDI...either:
		- hide the Measure,Bar,Division labels
		- show correct info on them
	X playToolbar should either switch to a STOP button
		X create a STOP button (b2.gif) 
		X use it when the PLAY button is selected 
	X I18N of this strings at PLAY PANEL
		X "Song" 
		X "Measure" 
		X "Beat"
		X "Division" 

/ add this Windows operations : (see DGDesktopPane)
	X Close all windows
	/ Cascade, (more testing)
	- Tab Layout (arrange windows in tabs)
	- Grid Layout (arrange windows in a matrix)
	- Tile Horiz
	- Tile Vert
	- minimize all (or selected ones)
	- restore all (or selected ones)

/ Work on the visual playing of a Score
	X move all musicCursor syncronized
	X When the music is auto-scrolled, the bars are now refreshed correclty 
	X how to perform the automatic horizontal scrolling 
	- When the cursor goes back before the actual measure, the scrolling is not going back as expected
	- When the BARS are really wide..the forward scrolling happens before the MusicCursor has moved

/ SLIDES
	X The width depends on the Beat Width
	- a SLIDE can join a note on the beat 1 with a note on the beat 3
	- Slides go on a SEPARATE LAYER since it can join beats on different measures
		see	TrackPanel.java (TrackPanel method)
	X create the index method for the Slide types
	X depending on the IndexNumber the EON Label will be GIF or custom PAINTED
	X The setAnchor position for SLIDE_IN_* objects is not working fine.
	- adjust the getPoint method to set the EXACT location
	- the width of the slide must me narrow (depends on the width of the fret)
	- The inclination of SLIDE_SHIFT and SLIDE_LEGATO depends on the 
	  NextFret on the same string..like this..
		if (NextFret >= currentFret)
			"/"
		else
			"\" 

/ OTHER Effects On NoteS (EONs)
    - hammer/pulls are allways draw after the current beat.
	- grace notes to the left of origin note
    / there are other bend types, besides the 5 types that are now shown
    / the horizontal line that conects the vertical rhythm lines (more testing)
    	- when beats contain silences...horizontal rhythm lines are showing 
		(see blue.gp4)

/ The MIDI events are not showing correct info (see emails from Chris arround March 06-2005)

/ create and option called "enable unfinished features" so user can decide if he wants to see/test this...
	X create the menu check box and I18N text
	- Store the "enable unfinished features" on preferences file
	X DISPLAY OPTIONS for all songs
	- SLIDES
	- Printing
	- other unfished options

-------------
BRAINSTORMING
-------------

- Provide a method for opening a ZIP file that contains FILES of supported extensions
	- MySongBook and many other people distribute songs in Zip format
	- this will allow to actually open a file direclty from the internet
	
- store the location and settings of the different windows to be able to open them in the 
  last location the user place them

- keep USAGE STASTICS that records how the program is used
    - if it is the first launch ask the user if he would like to keep track of how the program is used
         - start counting days
         - initialize and increase counter on each menu or clickable item
         - record attempts to use right-click and keyboard shurtcuts
         - after 10 days of use ask the user if he wants to report how the program is used to us
         	- if not...wait for other 10 days
         	- else...show a text file..with the recorded statistis so user know what is to be sent
    			send the statistics....by mail ...or with small socket application.         	

- detect if is the first launch and ask the user if he wants to configure the main settings
	- use/finsh developing the wizard classes of the Common package

- create a "REPORT THIS LOG" button for the LOG WINDOW:
	- this will open a EMAIL composing message with the typical info for error
		- version
		- the content of the log
		- description of how the error/bug was produced
	
- create an option to compare to MIDI files...
	Example of use:
	
	from a single GP file two MIDIs can be created:
		1. from a the original GuitarPro program
		2. from the current DGuitar player
	In this way the differences can be reduced and the playback improved

- "Realistic Sound" anyone up for the challenge ?
	Midi sound can be improved..but its still not as good as other tools : 
		SweetGuitar or Real Sound Engine provide a more realistic sound

----------------------------------
THINGS TO IMPLEMENT
----------------------------------

/ The colors options should also be available from the DGuitar menus, 
	 - allow user to change colors to all (open) pieces ..see SongAction methods  ;
	 X create/test a setDisplayOptions method at SongPanel
	 / create/test a setDisplayOptions method at SongInternalFrame
	 - when a ColorDialog is open it should alse refresh those colors
	 - call validate on SongPanel
	 - store the display Preferences in the DGuitar.properties

- Use IzPack to create a DGuitar installer to Improve the way the program is "installed" 
	and executed since many users having problems with the LANG folder..
	for example when running this command 

	java -jar DGuitar-dev/DGuitar/dist/DGuitar.jar

	this is happening:

	1. a dialog windows that shows "/home/mgracia//lang/lang NOT FOUND"

	2.after clickin OK this appears on the LOG:
		DGuitar (under testing) 0.5.3	28/11/2005 04:20:21 AM
		Operational System: Linux version 2.6.9-1.667 	architecture i386
		Java:  "Sun Microsystems Inc." version 1.4.2_04
		Supported Extensions:[.GP3, .GP4, .GTP, .MID]
			java.lang.NullPointerException
			at dguitar.gui.DGuitar.load(DGuitar.java:1310)
			at dguitar.gui.DGuitar.main(DGuitar.java:587)

	- find a way to avoid/fix this error (there are tools that help to install JAVA applications)


- Instruments LIST is returned EMPTY when different MIDI DEVICES are selected

- When trying to run "DGuitar.sh" with a command similiar to this "DGuitar-dev/DGuitar/DGuitar.sh" this errors is displayed:
	Exception in thread "main" java.util.zip.ZipException: No such file or directory
		at java.util.zip.ZipFile.open(Native Method)
		at java.util.zip.ZipFile.<init>(ZipFile.java:112)
		at java.util.jar.JarFile.<init>(JarFile.java:127)
		at java.util.jar.JarFile.<init>(JarFile.java:65)

	CAUSE: this happens because your trying to run the program from another folder different than DGuitar location

	SOLUTION: 
		1. go to the folder were the DGuitar.sh is located (for example DGuitar-dev/DGuitar/ or the folder were you unzip DGuitar
)
		2. run the shell like this "./DGuitar.sh" 


- Drag and Drop DOES NOT WORK using KDE konqueror (problems are reported by at least one user)
	- test with other Linux File Explorers (with the FileExplorer of GNOME it works)

- Under LINUX ( with KDE and GNOME) this Warning appears when launching DGuitar	
	Cannot convert string "-b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-sans-*-140-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1" to type FontStruct 

- The minimum size of this windows needs to be set for:
	- DGuitar LOG WINDOW 
	- Color Options
	- test other windows

- Playing a Large GP file has a poor perfomance/timing
	---------------------------------------------------------
	TITLE OF THE SONG			Complete adapting process time
	---------------------------------------------------------
	Metallica - Solos Of Metallica.gp4 	248 KB/256 seconds
	Opeth - Deliverance.gp4  		165 KB/166 seconds
	Hotel California.gp3			62 KB/14 seconds

	OPTIONS:
	A) estimate the time to Adapt the song and display a INFORMATION window if its too long 
	B) use the ProgressBar with a SwingWorker, that pops-up after a FIXED time

	- Under LINUX FEDORA 3 its sound cropped, more tests
	- PLAYing a SONG for the second time is not fast (re-adapting is required at this moment)

- Change the width of the MusicCursor when its a whole beat, 
	its crossing the Measure number (no complaints, but..)

- see HTTP-ERROR.txt for a Random error that has happend on my computer..not reported by anybody else
		
- AutoScroll of DGuitar LOG window (no complaints, but expected/usefull)

---------------------
FOR MATTHIEU WIPPLIEZ
---------------------
  - check the chords version 3 in version 4 files
	  - FILE: "Dimanche Matin Soleil.gp4" COULD NOT BE OPEN

		ERROR:  GP4decoder.GP4FormatException: 
			Chord Diagrams are in GP3 format
			Which are not documented
	
	    The readChordDiagram from GP3Decoder was used but it did not work

  - check the chord diagram in version 4 at the end of file
	  
  - check additional bytes at the end in files from version 3 or 4.

  - decode the version 1 (we will be able to open any guitar pro file)
      
  - wideVibrato and FadeIn are undocumented (on the GuitarPro format description)

-------------------
FOR CHRIS NASH
-------------------
 
- Adjustable tempo for playback 	

- Ability to mute channels

------------------------------------------------
OTHER DESIRED FEATURES LONG TERM - BRAINSTORMING

- create a DGIterator that allows to create a list of GTP files/folders and then perform different actions
	- plays them.
	- exports them to MIDI
	- export from GPx to GPy (x,y = [1,2,3,4])
	
	This DGIterator should ALSO work as an external tool that does not need DGuitar GUI.

- when the Color options are disabled...the MiniPanel color should be changed to gray 
	(disabling the buttons visually)

- when the view is MultiTab view, provide an option that moves the scroll bars simultaneously (when not playing)

- windows that are open from the PieceInternalFrame 
	- should be added to the destkop ?? or a Dialog (as no-modal, with parent)?

- GUI methods should be dependent of Abstract clases like SCORE,TRACK and so on
	- not linked direclty to GP4* classes
	- Design and created GUI components for the information that GTP4Decoder can read       
	    - Track information
	    - Other information (Tempo, Key, Octave,MixTableChange)

- Add and option to RE-DETECT available languages 

- BARS should know when is required to relocate the EON LABELS 
	- to avoid unecesary call to paintEffects and improve repainting methods.
	- when the TOOLtip is show and then hidden, JAVA calls repaint on the objects that were covered

- Improve the way the Strings of MENUS are handled
	- abstract class java.util AbstractMap:
	allows to link one Object with Another :
		link StringKeys of menus with Integer of the menu IDs, consider HOT-KEY binding

	this should allow to use MENU_PROGRAM instead of "MENU_PROGRAM" when I18N
	- this can be used to evalute wich menu options was clicked.

CODE
****

/ Clear UNUSED, OLD and Warning statements on all sources !!

/ Comment at least every method of any class !!!
	- when a new method, field or class is created document it inmediatly 

- Change all reference to PIECE...to SONG...for clarity

/ all variables in English ! (variables that contain "ant" should be changed to "prev"

/ make sure that the least posible calls to "validate()" and "invalidate()" is perfomed
------------------------------------
